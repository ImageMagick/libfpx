This package is currently maintained by the ImageMagick Studio,
http:://www.imagemagick.org/. It is available from
ftp://ftp.imagemagick.org/pub/ImageMagick/delegates/ as well as via
the 'fpx' module from ImageMagick CVS. All change history, starting
with the original distribution is available in ImageMagick CVS.

The Flashpix OpenSource Toolkit, is based on source code obtained from
the Digital Imaging Group Inc., and includes a sample FlashPIX library
implementation contributed by the Eastman Kodak Company.

The package was extended and modified by gurupix@hotmail.com to compile under
Solaris 2.7 using gcc 2.95.2 and GNU make.

The package was further extended and modified by Bob Friesenhahn
<bfriesen@simple.dallas.tx.us> to support a Unix build environment based on
GNU Autoconf, Automake, and Libtool. The build environment is based on a
'configure' script. The makefiles created by gurupix@hotmail.com were
slightly modified in order to be able to coexist (to serve as a reference)
with the configure-based build environment.

Bill Radcliffe <BillR@corbis.com> has provided key support for the Flashpix
toolkit, both as a member of the Digital Imaging Group (the Flashpix
Initiative Group), and as a member of ImageMagick Studio, the creators of
ImageMagick.

<mi+imagemagick@aldan.algebra.com> provided a mega-patch for the libfpx-1.3.0
release which permits libfpx to compile cleanly on i386 and amd64.
